Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?<br>Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.<br><br>

        <p><span class="a"><span class="first-letter">T</span>here weren't too many surprises in the fireside chat for me, as I researched DBC pretty extensively before deciding to commit with my deposit. I've seen other interviews with Shereef, and read enough to be familiar with a lot of the style and content of the rhetoric, although not with the particular metaphors used here. Shereef is, of course, really charismatic and engaging, so this is most effective coming directly from him. The main difference, I suppose, in this encounter with the rhetoric, is that it comes in the context of just having found out about the 'acquisition' of DBC by Kaplan Bigevil Megacorp, Inc... This makes all the homey, 'kitchen vs restaurant', *this is just a group of passionate people collaborating creatively* spin a little harder to take seriously, and it is tough to reconcile the apparent passion and personal commitment of the Shereef in the 'fireside chat' with the fact that this guy just sold the whole kitchen to one of the world's biggest and most aggressive players in the toxic game of commoditizing education.  <br>
        That being said, all of the ideas expressed in the rhetoric still appeal to me. I like the idea of self-directed education combined with the highly social, collaborative approach to creativity. I've been learning programming just for a few months now, and all completely on my own through online turorials and solo experimenting. The whole time I've been eagerly looking forward to the opportunity to work together with other students, and learn from the great teachers at dbc, and I'm thrilled to be getting started. If anything, the Kaplan buyout makes the specialness of DBC as it exists now all the more poignant and precious, since it is likely not long for the world. I plan to get the most out of it before it goes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event">extinct</a>, or at least evolves into something  very different. <br>
