      I guess I would have to say 'purpose', which is not on there, as in having a project that is motivating me or a clearly defined set of expectations that I can strive to meet or exceed--a way to excel. But this to be balanced I think with 'Close relationships'. Purpose without human closeness makes a person militant.

      actually that is bullshit, my key to happiness has always been an unflinching dedication to the triumvirate of:

      <ul>
        <li><span class="first-letter">R</span>adness</li>
        <li><span class="first-letter">H</span>ilariousness</li>
        <li><span class="first-letter">D</span>eliciousness</li>
          </ul>

      these are the lights that have guided my ship on the sea of whatever.

      Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.
    </div>
    <div class='a'>
      Radness is extremely important because it keeps everything from being pointless and boring. As entropy increases in a given locally observable region of the universe, everything tends to become more boring and lame over time. Radness exists in short, quasi-stable bursts as non-heat energy (which imposes a theoretical ceiling on local radness) is converted to heat. As well, recent discoveries shed light on the seemingly  paradoxical tendency of radness to emerge as an emergent structural phase of negative hotness or so-called 'chill factor'.
    </div>

    <div class='q'>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:
        In general, I try to live up to these values:
        Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</div>
    <div class ='a'>
      In general, I try to live up to the value of radness: 5 
    </div>
    <div class ='a'>
      In general, I try to live up to the value of hilariousness: 5

    <div class ='a'>
      In general, I try to live up to the value of deliciousness: 5

      What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
    </div>
    <div class='a'>
      i had to search through my gmail inbox for this one. a year ago, when i was early in my postdoc at IU, a prospective grad student emailed me to ask whether he should go to IU (where my postdoc was at the time) or UC Davis, where I did my PhD. Based on compatibility of his interests with the faculty, and the fact that IU is higher ranked (which helps for the job market for the rest of your life since all the constipated old bastards that make the hiring decisions fetishize 'pedigree.') I suggested IU. He came for a year, was miserable because of how shitty the culture is (which I was finding out at the same time), as well as the godawful weather, and ended up leaving to go to UC Davis after all. So I pretty much felt like a jack-ass.

    <div class='q'>
How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?

Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
    </div>
<div class='a'>
  i think the values that I need to focus on are humility and compassion, as I tend to be kind of an egotistical asshole. i think DBC overall will be good for me, as it will involve team problem-solving instead of pitting me against other people.
