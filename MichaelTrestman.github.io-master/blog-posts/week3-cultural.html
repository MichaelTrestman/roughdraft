              <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>y results on the Gregorc test are more confusing than anything, as I come out almost perfect balanced between abstract sequential, abstract random, and concrete random, with a flat zero for the other one. I don't really know that would help me in DBC, but at this point in my life I hopefully have I have some degree of understanding of my strengths and weaknesses.<br><br> 
                One thing that the Gregorc test does seem to hone in on is that organization is not my strong suit. This was on display for me in DBC so far as after two weeks I'd done all of the work without any problem, but I hadn't properly submitted through the Socrates app... It's a nice illustration of how I can get in trouble by ignoring the details...

              I am pretty into the idea of growth mindset, and it was one of the things that first struck a chord with me when I started reading about DBC before deciding to apply. In my previous career as an academic writer I'd been getting frustrated with the 'expert' mindet that is so common--people have their professional identity tied to being <emph> right</emph> about some issue, or <emph>knowing</emph> the most about a topic, that it tends to stifle productive intellectual dialogue. This tends to foster a 'fixed' mindset, where everyobody is defensively poised to counter any objection or spin any new discovery in a way that allows them to preserve their prior theories. As a result, people tend to avoid what they know the least about rather than facing it head on--which is inimical to a growth mindset. While I've always been more into the discovery and creative modeling aspects of research, than the objection-and-parry of figuring out who said what exactly correctly, but it is hard not to get sucked into it.<br>
              In any case, the opportunity afforded by learning programming and development--to learn as a beginner, to learn something very different than anything I'd done before, was very appealing, in large because it would be a chance to shift into more of a growth mindset. As a programmer, I have no baggage of past successes or failures; I am pure potential again, like a newly hatched pteradactyl, spreadinig its wings for the first time.<br>
              I'm also very much looking forward to the immersively social nature of learning used by DBC, and hopefully afterward, wherever I end up. Writing gets a bit lonely, and I think I'll enjoy being able to work collaboratively with a team as a developer.<br><br>
