                As far as how it has affected my life, i would have to say that i'm in the group of people that has probably benefitted from stereotype threat. as a jewish dude whose parents thought he was just the specialest most brilliant kid in the history of the universe, that is one big set of baggage that never weighed me down. the implication is that whenever i was evaluated in a classroom with other students who did, statistically, suffer a penalty from the effects of stereotype threat, i essenetially got a slight inflation. It's as if i were being tested together with some students who had to take the test with less time or in a noisy environment or with some other slight but significant and persistant disadvantage--and statistically, it makes me seem slightly smarter than i actually am. that is definitely humbling.

                Stereotype threat is an important issue in any kind of collaborative or educational environment, and DBC is definitely one of those. As far as what to do about it, the broad theme that emerges from research on ways to ameliorate the effects of stereotype threat is emphasizing people's individuality and positive traits helps. <br>
                to me this reinforces that the 'checking in' exercise that we always do at the beginning of pairing sessions is a good idea. stereotype threat affects people when their membership into stereotyped categories is emphasized and made salient, and it melts away when their individuality is emphasized.<br>
                another practical implication that springs to mind is that humor that focuses on race and gender, <emph>even when well-meaning</emph>, can make people uncomfortable and effect their performance simply by making racials categories salient.<br>
                I know lot's of white dudes that seem to think that it's ok to make edgy or borderline offensive jokes as long as everyone understands that they aren't racist or misogynist. I think there are contexts where edgy humor is fine, where everybody understands what they are in for and is willing to have their sensibilities shocked for a good laugh, but unless those conditions really are fulfilled, it is not ok to push the limits with racially charged or sexually charged humor. Work or school is a context where it's never ok, since people are there, not to joke around, but to work/learn. In a context like that, nobody can avoid your jokes if they find them offensive, and there is tremendous social pressure not to even say anthing, as this is usually perceived as a kind of aggressive escalation. Therefore, not receiving negative feedback on your racist/sexist jokes is not a good indication that they aren't racist/sexist. It's always better to play it safe and <emph>not</emph> be a jerk. Besides, if you can't be funny without being offensive, then you probably can't be funny at all.
