              <p><span class="first-letter">P</span>airing so far has been mostly frustrating just because it's such a little taste of what's to come. My experience has been limited by technical issues (grrrr internets!) and time constraints, as I am in the process of moving across the country from indiana to sf. <br>

<span class="q">                It has been super cool though just meeting other folks from DBC, <span class="a">proof that <span class="q">i am not the </span>only one <span class="q">buying <span class="a">a ticket</span> for this ride.</span>
</span></span>
                 a bummer actually, meeting people who aren't going to be in SF with me since they seem liek they'd be cool to work with. <br>

               a little frustrating too because we're all still learning the ropes in so many ways, so we haven't really been solving problems or building things, so much as fumbling about trying to get comfortable and make sure everything's plugged in and turned on, so to speak. of course, this is how you learn, and so it's all good. But i guess i still dont' know what it' slike to pair on something an dhave that be an effective way of getting something done, rather than just an exercise in learning about pairing, is alls i'm saying.

      <span class="a"><span class="first-letter">Ffle</span>eedback, so mouch feedback. <span class="first-letter">W</span>hy so much feedback?<span class="first-letter">?</span> It seems a bit forced to me. Is the point that it helps them improve DBC, or that it is part of my learning experience. I feel like i've seen the latter claim in the rhetoric, but it doesn't seem particularly plausible. Like what is the point of this blogging about feedback that i am literally typing write now as i type this? is this feedback? is blogging about feedback feedback? is my feedback being evaluated? am i going to get metametafeedback on this metafeedback? it's like if you screen share in google hangouts and you catch a glimpse down into the dizzying depths of the visual feedback dimensional gateway, sucking you down into feedbackinator feedbacking feeedback feeedback. feeeedback. feedbackfeedback.</span>
