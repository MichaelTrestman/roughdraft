    </div>

    <div class="post">
      <h2 class="a"><span class="first-letter">M</span>argin, border, and padding.</h2>

        <span class="q">Together, these three attributes make up the 'box model', which is a big part of how CSS determines the way DOM elements take up space in the browser window. <br>
      </span>

      <div class="box-wrapper">
      	<h6>the box model</h6>
      	<div class="box">
      		<p>Content</p>
      	</div>
      </div>

      <span class="q">What is the basic difference?</span>
      <span class="a">The border is the boundary between the element and it's surrounding DOM environment. In the diagram, the div with class "box" has a purple background and a white border. The white border seperates the purple background of the "box" div from the black background of the surrounding "box-container" div.<br>
      	Padding seperates the content (in this case, the word "content"), from the border. More padding, more space inside the div--in this case, more purple.<br>
      	Margin seperates the element from other elements in the containing div. In this case, that would be between the white boundary whatever else is floating around in the DOM with the 'box' div.<br>
      </span>
  	</div>

      <span class="q">When should you use a class?</span>

      <span class="a">

        Classes can be applied many times, and a single DOM element can have many classes. This is powerful for giving structure to the visual appearance of page, and can allow you to quickly establish a coherent style website with lots of content and many pages. Partial overlap of the style classes between html elements  (i.e. some but not all classes shared), can be used to establish visual hierarchy and grouping.

      </span>
      <span class="q">When should you use an ID?</span>

      <span class="a">

        One element may only have one ID, and an ID may only apply to a single element within an HTML documents. This limits their utility for styling; in general, classes give you more flexibility for the reasons above. However, IDs can be used to style elements that are unique within a page (but may appear on multiple pages within a site), such as a header, nav bar or footer.<br>
        IDs also allow you to anchor links within a page, and are very useful for that reason.
