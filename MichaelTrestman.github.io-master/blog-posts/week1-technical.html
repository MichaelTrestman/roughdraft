      <h2><span class="first-letter">W</span>ikipedia</h2>

      <span class="q">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</span>

      <span class="a">Wikipedia represents perhaps the largest project in knowledge agglomeration in human history. It is an encyplopedia of staggering scope, that would have awed intellectuals from throughout human history if they could have even conceived of its possibility. We are a priveleged few to live in a time that wikipedia exists. It is a anthropogenic miracle, one of the wonders of the world.<br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">
      Wikipedia actually is sort of unusual in that most visitors don't see the root page. At least, that is my strong suspicion. I'd guess most visitors are directed to a content-page (i.e. an article) by a google search, or by following an internal link from another Wikipedia page. The 'Main Page', <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> follows the format of other pages, highlighting the text content by keeping other things out of the way.
      </span><br><br>

      </span>

      <span class="q">
      How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Functional</li>
          <li>Minimal</li>
          <li>Simple</li>
          <li>Timeless</li>
          <li>Vast</li>
        </ul>
        Wikipedia is about as simple as it cold possibly be design-wise. Black text on a white background makes. Embedded pics. Search field, nav bar. That is all. Wikipedia's design scheme is all about function. it is very readable and the design, such as it is, stands out of the way of the information. This also allows the contributions to be egoless and anonymous.<br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        All the content. Wikipedia is a crowd-sourced encyclopedia of everything. the whole idea is that allows anyone in the world to share whatever information they think is important with everyone else in the world. <br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">
      What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        <ul>
          <li>Informative (how could this not be on there?)</li>

          <li>Timeless</li>

        Obviously the two lists are related.<br><br>

      <span class="q">How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        As noted above, a typical user doesn't navigate from the homepage. Wikipedia is pervasively integrated into the larger ecosystem of the web. Many wikipedia content pages are among the top few search hits from google and other engines, and most websites that aspire to be informative have links to Wikipedia.<br><br>

          While it is possible to spend really almost any amount of time browsing Wikipedia, I wouldn't call it a waste of time. Well there is plenty of potential for wasting time there, but it really just depends on what you're looking at.

      <span class="a">
        Wikipedia is a nonprofit foundation run on donations, which is frigging awesome. I have donated, and plan to in the future.

      <a href="http://www.onezoom.org"><h2><span class="first-letter">O</span>nezoom.org</h2></a>

      <span class="q">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</span>

      <span class="a">

        Onezoom is a website that takes a unique approach to displaying phylogenetic tree data in an interactive and aesthetically engaging way--a problem that I am keenly interested in. Most phylogenetic displays are not zoomable and pannable, and onezoom also has found a way to make the experience visually compelling. I think their solution has some sharp limitations (no trait-mapping, limited manipulability, limited information display), but this is a challenging design problem, and I think what they've done is pretty cool. I find it's successes and limitations extremely helpful, as I'm currently <a href="http://michaeltrestman.github.io/D3treeExperiments/littTreeGenerator.html">

        experimenting </a> with more complete solutions.

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">

        It actually sort of depends on which option you choose for the 'fractal shape' option. The default is a curly clockwise spiral which leads the eye around from branch to branch. This scales nicely as you zoom in on a very speciose taxon, but one problem I have with it is that it seems to visually imply an ordering among the taxa on a branch--which is arbitrary and not biologically real. One simple solution they could offer is a button to 'reshuffle' the ordering of the branches--to remind a relatively naive viewer that the ordering is in fact arbitrary. Even cooler would be you could click to drag branches and have them kind of spring back into some sort of shape, but to allow the user to rearrange the shape of the branches. This is why I like using <a href="http://michaeltrestman.github.io/D3treeExperiments/force.html"> force-diagrams</a>, although obviously my solution is still very primitive

      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        The basic problem the site tries to solve is making datasets about phylogenetic relationships visually intuitive and explorable. They have pretty good datasets of tetrapods and green plants, although that's about it. This is actually a bit surprising. What is their data management solution like, that it isn't really easy to just add more archived data? A solution to this problem should be scalable. I wonder why they haven't expanded more.

        Meh at best. Search functionality is not great, and even the search bar itself is hidden among a set of inscrutable buttons along a head-bar, that you have to hover over to see what they do.<br><br>

        Fairly easy. Despite the fact that you have tens of thousands of taxa in their database, what onezoom does well is the dynamic zoom and pan, allowing you to quickly traverse this dataset using 2d graphic space as a proxy medium for phylogenetic relationships, a la <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=darwin+phylogenetic+tree&es_sm=91&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=zEWwU4mMCIOcyATpjIDQBA&ved=0CC4QsAQ&biw=1280&bih=679">the Darwinian conception</a>.

        <ul>
          <li>Inspired--to improve on their attempt, </li>

          Really, I've never spent too much time browsing the site, compared to just cruising the phylogenetic data on even a visually static (and way crappier in a design senes) site like <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree/">tolweb.org</a>, because the latter has more actual info to explore (although tolweb kind of sucks because a lot of their tree data is super out of date--they must have implemented a really crappy database solution, if its so hard to update). Honestly, Wikipedia is still a better way to learn about phylogenetic relationships, because each taxonomic node has lots of extra information, so there's something to actually learn as you browse other than just a bunch of disembodies names arrayed in space--where most of the spatial organization is not actually informative.

        No I think it was paid for by a limited grant or something, which probably has a lot to do with why it hasn't been improved much beyond the original one-trick functionality.

      <a href="http://www.howlt.com/"><h2><span class="first-letter">h</span>owlt.com</h2></a>

      <span class="q">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</span>

      <span class="a">

          Well, I didn't know about this website until today, but the other sites I picked to blog about, I picked because of their content/function, without much regard for design aspects (except in a very functional sense). I discovered howlt.com via awwwards.com's list of best webistes. Really, this site breaks a lot of my general rules for what i consider good websites: I generally think bells and whistles should be kept to a minimum, and this website is basically just a collection of bells and whistles (it even starts playing music automatically on page-load, which seems like a terrible idea generally). However, it is a SUPER skillfully put together collection of bells and whistles, and it comes together for a really fun experience. navigating the website is like playing a game, and that is a really powerful thing to achieve. I also just think I can learn a lot of cool techniques by exploring the css and javascript for the site. 
        <br><br>
      </span>

      <span class="q">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</span>

      <span class="a">

        The site is animated upon loading, with some weird blimp thing floating across the screen, and clouds, and weird little cartoony icons and things. it is somewhat visually confusing, but in an engaging, exploration-inviting way. As I noted already, this seems to me to totally break many of the rules of good web design, but in a deliberate and powerful way that can be very informative to study.

      What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?
      </span>
      <span class="a">
        The website is basically just an artists playground. Its ostensive purpose is to display the artwork of the artist, Haruki Higashi, but the line between the artwork displayed and the website display as itself a work of art is totally permeable.

      </span>
      <span class="a">
        I think the list has to just be the same as the list above, since the design style of the website really just is its content/function; the two aren't really seperable.

        Not easy. You have to really explore with the mouse to even find what strange floating animated objects are nav links. Like I said, it's more like a game than a regular website.

        Not easy, I really don't know how much of the content I've seen after playing with the website for a while. There is a top level nav bar, but there's nothing like a top level gallery of content to let you get your bearings. You just kind of wander around...<br><br>
